## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
The data set contains the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusion
- Model is build using custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- Augmentation is used to handle immbalance in data.
- Model Evaluation:
